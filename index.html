        <p>They say learn from your mistakes. That's why I 'm making as many as possible. Soon, I'll be a genius! Better days are just around the corner.....They are called Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. It takes real skills to choke on air, fall up the stairs and trip over nothing. I have those skills. All my life I thought air was free. Then I bought a bag of chips. People say nothing is impossible, but I do nothing every day.</p>

           <p> People said follow your dreams, so I went back to bed. When nothing is going right, go left. Relationships are like a walk in the park. Jurassic Park. I am not lazy I am on energy saving mode. I am on a seafood diet. I see food, and I eat it. Some people just need a high-five. In the face. With a chair. They say learn from your mistakes. That's why I 'm making as many as possible. Soon, I'll be a genius!</p>
